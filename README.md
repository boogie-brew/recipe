# Open Source Compost Tea | Boogie Brew

### **We are now proud to offer ALL of the ingredients that we use in our own nutrient-based tea recipe! Below is an outline of the individual ingredients which have been developed by Boogie Brew to make "The World's Greatest Compost Tea".**

 

**Boogie Brew** is proud to offer both commercial-scale farmers & hobby-level brewers alike with the opportunity to purchase the very same highly-valued individual tea ingredients that we already source from our own vendors.

If you are a beginner or new to compost tea, we have [Compost Tea Brewing Kits][1] that have everything you need to brew our popular tea here: 

Are you are resourceful farmer who has already sourced or even produced a superb worm casting for themselves? Perhaps you already create your own super-compost, or a home-made biochar? After all, backyard units like the Jora Composter, ([which we are also proud to sell here][2]), can create some of the richest home-crafted compost blends on earth, and BioChar-Ovens are also now becoming available at affordable prices too.

The point is, with enough energy & resources, you can always take the time to craft your own [**BASE**][3], and then _boost_ it with nutrients as you see fit, too! This is one of the reasons why our [**BOOGIE-BOOST©**][4] has quickly gained so much popularity by itself, (as a stand-alone tea-fortifying product).

For folks who just can't resist the notion of producing their very own "Uber-Boogie" Tea, we are proud to offer [**DOWN-TO-EARTH][5]*** individual products (as used in Boogie Brew), along with other quality-sourced ingredients like _LeSaffre® Nutritional Yeast,  Sucanat® Organic Cane Juice Crystals, Sonoma Compost BioChar_ and _MaxiCrop Soluble Seaweed._

**∗Please Note:** Only **DTE Veeganic©** ingredients are used in our tea; you may also shop for their other **non-Veeganic©** fertilizers on our dedicated **DTE page** here:  
[www.boogiebrew.net/down-to-earth-natural-fertilizers][6]

If you are SERIOUS about brewing tea, and you want to try to save even more money on our already sensibly-priced "Bulk Granola" style products, ([**BOOGIE-BASE©][7], [BOOGIE-BOOST© ][8]& [BOOGIE-BREW PRO©][9] Duo-Packs**), then you now have the ultimate choice in _"Open Source"_ tea-supplies.

You now have the option of buying the **Best Selling Compost Tea **in North America purchasing the individual ingredients listed below and making your _own_ Boogie Blend!

### **  
Cost-Comparison of Home-Mixed, "Open Source" tea ingredients vs Boogie Base© & Boogie Boost©: **

The cost to purchase your own ingredients vs the premixed recipe in our packaged **Boogie Brew Pro** Tea formulas is actually only moderately cheaper, and that is _only_ if you are willing or able to purchase and store much larger combined quantities of the individual ingredients listed above. Obviously, the more tea ingredients you are willing to buy and store in bulk, the lower the cost becomes. It really comes down to a choice of convenience for the smaller amounts of tea needed vs cost-savings for the larger commercial quantities needed by larger-scale farmers. Below is a table and list of ingredients, along with the approximate cost per lb, (actual costs of each ingredient varies depending on the sizes and amounts purchased). The hassle-factor, (time required to store and mix the ingredients oneself), is another factor worthy of consideration. At Boogie Brew, we are glad to provide _**all farmers with all options.**_ Keep in mind that this also includes the availability of _**Commercial Farmer Pricing****,** _which allows for significantly lower-than-retail prices on our (pre-mixed) **Boogie Brew products**. In addition, **Boogie Brew** continually produces excellent values on **combined package deals** which are available through popular garden channels on YouTube / Internet-Blogs etc.

So, when you stop and consider the obvious value that is already inherent in Boogie products, at all price ranges, does it really make sense to undertake the task of mixing up your own uber-tea recipe?…….Well, it comes down to a matter of choice: Boogie Brew firmly recognizes that home-gardeners are generally avid **_"Do-It-Yourself"("D.I.Y'ers")_**. We also understand how plenty of folks tend to enjoy the art of tinkering with their own garden "programs"; therefore, for those reasons, (and also for the sake of transparency), we are happy to make those choices available to all!
